# Livia
All Code related to the livia project


Livia was my first real attempt at a large project, and while its not great ... or very functional, i find my self reluctant to remove it.

I've evolved a lot as a programmer since this, and i like to look back at these scripts from time to time and compare this, to the new livia_revisted repository.
The game files for this are long gone, and i was still learning how to use github atthe time, but some of these scripts actually are quite helpful still. even if its just small portions.
